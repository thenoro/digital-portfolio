    "As part of this assignment, you will be helping a data scientist named Alex Do create her digital data science portfolio. Alex wants to present her skills, work, and interests in a professional manner using a digital website rather then a pile of various documents. To assist her in achieving this objective, you will use JupyterLab Books, which you have learnt about in this module. By the end of this task, you should have produced a portfolio that effectively captures Alex's knowledge and enthusiasm for data science while also being aesthetically pleasing and educational. In addition to giving you the chance to put the knowledge you gained in this module into practice, this assignment will give you the valuable opportunity to work on a real-life project and help someone advance their career.\n",
