```{tab-item} Things I learned
- Create, build and publish jupyter books
- Learn how to use the markup language for jupyter books 
- Publishing in Github Pages.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- Implement the markup correctly. A missing space messes up the formatting of the whole section.
- I run into an error that prevented the build of the book. `No such kernel named conda-base-py`. This code shared in Piazza solved my issue: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name conda-base-py --display-name "Python [conda env:base]"`
